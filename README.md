# Weather App

This repository is made for an assignment as part of doing the Full Stack Javascript course
from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard).

A simple weather application making use of the Visual Crossing API to retrieve information about
the weather in specified cities. The application also makes use of the Giphy API to retrieve
gifs reflecting the weather conditions.

The goal was to make use of both Async/Await functions and Promises to solidify my understanding
in the concepts.
